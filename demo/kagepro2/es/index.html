      <h4>Prologue - The Old Days</h4>

      <p>This part of the game is based on the drama CD of the same name. I hope you enjoyed the euclidean geometry. I have to admit I’m not very good at it...</p>

      <h4>Chapter 1 - Artificial Enemy</h4>

      <em>Highlight the text to read spoilers of the game after Shintaro leaves his room!</em>
      <p>This is a big mix of the ‘artificial enemy’ parts of each medium, <span class="spoiler">however, the subway part was totally made up! </span> <br>
      Logan designed and programmed Shin’s computer from scratch, I hope you liked it! it still needs a cringe background though.<br>
      <span class="spoiler">Just in case you’re curious, the subway backgrounds were made from the station champ de mars in Paris, a Tokyoite wagon and the map on the wall is London underground! I bet you have no idea who these mysterious kids you met on the train are… </span></p>
