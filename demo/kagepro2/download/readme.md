# Still unavailable ??

Hello, ShinProg here !

It seems like the build is still not available in Kagescan's servers.  
This means that I didn't have the time to publish it, or some translations still aren't finished...

## The official release time is 11 AM CET

Please wait few hours (I connect usually around 11AM and 11PM CET) or tomorrow.  
Sorry to make you wait on the great day of august 15 :/

Or if you're impatient, you can try to [Download the nightly source code](https://github.com/LoganTann/kagepro2/archive/master.zip), or [play it online](https://github.com/LoganTann/kagepro2/archive/master.zip). Remember that nightly builds could have bugs (yes, we are really late and works until midnight) or might not have translations.
